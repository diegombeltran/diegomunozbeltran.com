I usually get in touch by email with the following address:

_yo **at** diegomunozbeltran **dot** com_

I give **priority** (and habitually answer faster) to **encrypted** emails. My public key is [**here**](https://diegomunozbeltran.com/diegoPublicKey.asc).

You can find a complete and usefull website made by the [**FSF**](https://www.fsf.org), where they explain **how** asymmetric encryption works and **why** it's important, [**in this link**](https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en/).
