**Zyphra** is a _heavy rock_ band founded by **David Aldana** in 2005. During the time between 2010 and 2015, I was able to be part of that big **family**, had an album published, played a lot of live performances and shared a big amount of unforgettable moments with my partners.

Although I decided to leave the band to focus on my proffesional career and other hobbies, I still am a *zyphrian* (the most one!)... that's why I encourage others to follow the band and listen to their new material.
