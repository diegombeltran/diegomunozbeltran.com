Please note that this program does not offer rewards for bug submissions as **diegomunozbeltran.com** is just a small personal website.

This disclosure program is limited to assets in the scope found at the bottom of this page.

# Things To Look For

* Web application vulnerabilities (Command Injection, SSRF, CSRF, XSS, etc)
* Security misconfigurations
* Suggested security improvements
* Information leakage
* Multi-byte/binary exploitation
* Tor Hidden Service de-anonymization
* Security header configurations
* Content Security Policy (CSP) bypass
* DNS record configuration (SPF, DKIM, DMARC, CAA, etc)
* TLS configuration
* Code security audit/review
* Software that is more than 24 hours out of date
* Etc...

Feel free to use automated tools as long as you do not cause network/service disruption for me or third-parties.

Testing must not cause issues for other organisations such as hosting providers, network operators or ISPs (e.g. Cloudflare).

# Disclosure Policy

* Let me know of any potential vulnerabilities as soon as possible and I will make every effort to resolve the issue quickly.
* Share with me the full details of any vulnerability including steps to reproduce if applicable.
* Provide me a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before disclosure to the public or a third-party.
* Try to avoid degradation of service, destruction of data or privacy violations.

While researching, please do not attempt the following:

* Denial of service (DoS)
* Spamming
* Phishing
* Spoofing or hijacking
* Man in the Middle (MitM) or interception
* Attacks which require physical presence on the network of a user
* Domain name hijacking or theft
* Account hijacking or theft
* Cybersquatting
* Social engineering
* Physical/real-life attacks
* Anything that could falsely lower the reputation of me or my website
* Anything that could falsely get me in trouble
* Attacks on 3rd-party systems that are out of my general control
